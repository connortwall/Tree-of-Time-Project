# **Tree of Time Game** 

I created a 1st-person mini-game that uses a portal system, L-Systems, 
and entropy systems to travel between present and past to alter the growth of a small tree in the present. Movement through "time" -much like the mechainics in Dishonored 2 mission "A Crack in the Slab".
