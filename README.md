# Tree of Time Game (Work In Progress)
*Unity Game Project*
I created a 1st-person mini-game that uses a portal system, L-Systems, 
and entropy systems to travel between present and past to alter the growth of a small tree in the present.
I created 3rd-person movement system variation with attacks, dodges, sprint, targetable enemies, health + stamina drain, inventory UI, equipable weapon change for one-handed and two handed weapons.
I am currently working on more complex AI for enemies and a time slow and warp mechanic to move through "time" -much like the mechainics in Dishonored 2 mission "A Crack in the Slab".
